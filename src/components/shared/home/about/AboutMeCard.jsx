        Hey! <br></br>
        <br></br> I'm Cameron, a Full-Stack Software Engineer. As a dedicated and passionate software engineer, I bring two years of experience working in Software Asset Management (SAM) services, where I honed my skills in a diverse array of programming languages and technologies. My expertise lies in C#, Javascript, TypeScript, AngularJS, SQL, HTML, CSS, React, and Ruby, allowing me to build robust, scalable and efficient software solutions. My journey in software engineering is driven by a deep curiosity and a persistent desire to solve complex problems, resulting in software that not only meets but exceeds expectations. Whether working on back-end processes, front-end interfaces, or full-stack applications, I approach each project with a commitment to quality and a focus on delivering tangible results. I graduated from the DevPoint Labs Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp in 2021 where we used Ruby on Rails and React.js to build full-stack applications. I also graduated from Utah Valley University in 2022 with a BS in Information Systems with an emphasis in App Development.{" "}

      <p className="words-p">
        I'm dedicated to continuous learning and improvement in the ever-evolving field of software engineering. I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my skill set. I am passionate about creating software that is not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing. I am excited to bring my unique blend of technical expertise, creativity, and problem-solving skills to a team that values innovation and collaboration.{" "}
