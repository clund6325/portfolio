        Hey! <br></br>
        <br></br> I'm Cameron, a Full-Stack Web Developer hoping to break into the industry and make custom websites for clients. Currently, the main languages I use are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and React. I also have knowledge in C#, WordPress, PHP, and PostgreSQL. I graduated from the DevPoint Labs Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp in 2021 where we used Ruby on Rails and React.js to build full-stack applications. I also attend Utah Valley University in Orem, UT, where I'm attempting to complete my bachelor's degree.{" "}
